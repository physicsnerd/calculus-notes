Integrals are harder than derivatives. Half of solving them isn't knowing how integrals work, it's manipulating what's beside the integral sign so you can actually do something with it - and even then it's not always possible to find an equation for the solution. Numerical integration is a whole field for a reason. Most people look for a simple trick or two and then use a calculator like Wolfram Alpha to help them out, but it is useful to know some of the standard tricks out there for approaching problems.
