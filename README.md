# Calculus Notes
This small document, written in LaTeX, hopes to cover the basics of single-variable calculus. Currently, it is very close to achieving the basic version of that goal, needing only a finishing of the explanation of the formal definition of an integral, and an explanation of the epsilon-delta definition of a limit.

After this goal is achieved, more problems need to be added, and it would be nice to expand it to include some of the basics of multivariable calculus and differential equations as well.

# Use

Please feel free to use this project in any way except commercially. Also feel free to file an issue with the document here or just provide feedback. This book was written to be friendly to self-studiers - all problems have solutions in the back.

# Contributing

This document aims to follow basic style guidelines for LaTeX and also to make the subject of calculus as simple and as intuitive as possible. Any contributors are welcome, experienced or not!

## Things to do

1. Add practice problems (and solutions!)
2. Resolve issues
3. Start writing new sections on multivariable calculus, differential equations, applications, or other advanced topics
4. Clean up the style of the document - center pictures, clean up the code, etc.

## How to do them

Fork this project and add your content. If you need help with LaTeX, try [TeX Stack Exchange](tex.stackexchange.com) where there are many willing to help. Please attempt to make your explanations as simple and intuitive as possible, and always provide a solution for your problem in the solutions appendix. If you are writing a brand new section, please create a new file for it inside the tex-files folder and import it into main-file.tex.
