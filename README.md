# Calculus Notes
For awhile, I've been working on a set of notes on calculus - over break I finally rewrote a bunch of it and added in a bunch on applications that's covered in most actual calculus classes. I do still feel like most explanations of calculus don't cover it in a coherent way and explain where all the ideas come from, which is what I attempt to do in this. Please feel free to add issues with complaints about unclear sections, errors, topics I've missed, or anything else.

## Currently unfinished sections

1. As of yet, the limits section needs to add an explanation of L'Hopital's rule and epsilon-delta proofs.
2. The second derivatives section, integrals, and integral applications have all only been outlined, with only a few sections written.
3. The differential equations and sequences and series sections have not been started.
4. Might be a good idea to add problems/solutions in? Unsure.
